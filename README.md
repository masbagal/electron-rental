# electron-rental

My attempt on trying to build something in [electron](http://electron.atom.io)

Recreating my early college task on creating book rental management.

This stack used in this application's are :
 - [electron](http://electron.atom.io)
 - [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for the view
 - [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for the state management
 - [lovefield](https://google.github.io/lovefield/) for the embedded database
 - [material-ui])(www.material-ui.com) for the interface (too lazy to design for now)
